# Employee Dues
Create an Employee class that represents several types of employees within a company.

Have the program prompt the user to enter the type of employee (from a list of employee types). The program should also prompt the user to enter the number of meals being purchased.

Depending on the type of employee chosen, the program should calculate their cafeteria dues for the current month.

Employees: Temp = 2.75 per day, Full Time= free, Part Time =1.50
